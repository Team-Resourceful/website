                    <p>May 20, 2022 is World Bee day. In celebration, we at Team Resourceful will give every player a cosmetic bee in-game from May 15th to May 22nd. This cosmetic bee is typically reserved for our patrons, however from time-to-time we will give one to every player to celebrate special occasions.</p>
                    <p>Bees are an integral part of nature as pollinators and producers of honey and medicinal products. The movement of pollen between plants is necessary for plants to fertilize and reproduce. Both farmed and wild bees control the growth and quality of vegetation - when they thrive, so do crops.</p>

                                    <div class="bookmark-description">Bees and other pollinators, such as butterflies, bats and hummingbirds, are increasingly under threat from human activities. Pollination is, however, a fundamental process for the survival of our ecosystems. Nearly 90% of the world&#x27;s wild flowering plant species depend, entirely, or at least in part, on animal pollination, along with more than 75% of the world&#x27;s food crops and 35% of global agricultural land.</div>

                    <h2>Bee Charities</h2>
                    <p>If you would like to help our environment and the bees, then bee sure to plant outdoor flowers, leave patches of weeds or cut the grass less frequently, purchase local honey from beekeepers in your area or learn how to keep bees and harvest your own, or just place pollinator homes in your yard for bees to live in.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>You can also support non-profit organizations which are committed to sustaining the bee population by donating. We have found a few organizations which we beelieve would be worth supporting, but if none of these work for you, we encourage you to find local charities you can donate to.</p>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>Bees are important and vital to life on earth. They are responsible for 1 in 3 bites of food that we eat. Without them we might not be able to survive. If you have bees making homes on your property, consider leaving them bee, and if for some reason you are unable to then consider reaching out to a local beekeeper who can properly relocate them.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Resourceful Bees continues to grow with new users everyday. We appreciate the support of every one of you and we look forward to releasing the mod on newer versions of Minecraft. We anticipate our 1.0.0 release to occur in 1.19 due to some IRL setbacks with the devs. We also have several projects we are working on with regard to the mod such as a web-based bee editor and sharing site and a new wiki.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>On behalf of the team,</p>
                    <p>Thank you and celebrate World Bee Day in style!</p>
