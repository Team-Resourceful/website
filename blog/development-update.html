                    <p>Resourceful Bees for 1.19.2 is nearing an official public release. We privately informed our Patrons and Discord boosters about an alpha test and mentioned it a few times in our general chat in discord. We also posted an announcement of the test, but we didn‚Äôt take the liberty in alerting everyone. Well, now we are! We are currently adding in final missing bits of code and fixing bug reports that a few of our users have sent us. Within the coming weeks we should feel comfortable with a more public curse release, however there will be some caveats to the release:</p>

                    <h3>1.19.2/1.19.3</h3>
                    <p>With 1.19.3 snapshots currently going out we expect there will be a full release in the very near future. That said, 1.19.3 has quite a few internal breaking changes that will affect us and require us to refactor significant parts of our code. This is fine as it provides us with many new opportunities to make improvements and take advantage of code used in vanilla. However, because the changes are so significant we will drop support for 1.19.2 the moment we have a release for 1.19.3.</p>

                    <h3>Alpha/Beta</h3>
                    <p>In an effort to gain as much feedback on the major changes we‚Äôve made to the core of Resourceful Bees and ensure that it can adapt to that feedback, we will be choosing to release the mod in an alpha state. The alpha status will not change until the 1.19.3 release, at which point it will shift to beta and then out of beta when we feel that it is stable enough and won‚Äôt require any significant or breaking changes.</p>

                    <h3>GitHub Organization Change</h3>
                    <p>We would also like to inform everyone that we are changing the GitHub organization from Resourceful Bees to Team Resourceful due to the increasing number of projects being added to it. This may impact some links in the wild. </p>

                    <h1>Other Projects</h1>
                    <p>We are excited to share the Resourceful Bees update with the community and we know that everyone has been very patient while we work on it. Everyone on Team Resourceful has various IRL stuff which has impacted the time we can dedicate to the project, but we are still very passionate about it. Some of us have also worked on additional projects that either directly support Resourceful Bees or utilize what we‚Äôve learned while developing Resourceful Bees. We would like to make a more formal announcement regarding these projects:</p>

                            <p>Resourceful Lib is a project that was created to store common code that can be used across multiple projects it contains a number of features originally crated for Resourceful Bees but was found that in our other mods outside of Team Resourceful we copy and pasted this code often so we decided to put it in a library mod.</p>
                            <p>Some features include:</p>

                            <p>Liquified Honey is a mod that Oreo made after having an idea to make it so certain blocks can melt honey blocks into honey liquid in Resourceful Bees, but it was later turned into its own mod as it can possibly break redstone contraptions that honey blocks are used in. </p>

                            <p>Highlight is a mod which was created based on a system we designed for our new apiaries and breeder. Our new apiaries and breeders don‚Äôt follow a standard axis aligned model, therefore the selection box looked odd, so we replaced it with a non axis aligned system. We thought this new system would be great for others and put it into our library Resourceful Lib. Then we created this mod which provides default selection boxes for Minecraft blocks we thought would require them, such as the lectern.</p>
